# scraping_mars
module 11

# Part 1
In this section, we scraped the mars news website https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html with a selenium browser, and parsed it with beautiful soup to create a list of the article titles and the preview text for each article.

# Part 2
In this section, we used data from the website https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html] to extract the data from the table related to pressure and temperature. We manipulated this data using pandas tools and analyzed it to find information like average temps and pressures per martian month. Visualizations were also created to help understand this data. 

Referenced old homework assignments to refresh pandas and matplotlib syntax, and in class assignments for the browser and beautiful soup bits. fun one!
